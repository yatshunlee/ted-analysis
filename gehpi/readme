Node: (N = 380)
nodes are selected keywords (same as those in word2vec) in column "topics" of "ted_talks_en.csv" from https://www.kaggle.com/miguelcorraljr/ted-ultimate-dataset
All nodes size is the count of certain keyword in the whole "topics" column (Except All_nodes.png)

Edge:
edges are pairs of nodes co-exist in one ted talk

Weight: (Range from 1 to 359)
weights are the number of times the pairs of nodes co-exist in one ted talk
weights are used for the edge size

Filter:
No filter for All_nodes.png (Edges = 19799)
For others, filter weight >= 10 (Edges = 2496)

Graph:
Color = centrality measures, the higher the darker (Except All_nodes.png)
Only edges with weights > 120 shown
For pagerank_v2.png, only edges with weights > 100 shown, adjusted the edge size
